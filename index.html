            <h2>Feature list</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Add new PCA - can be multi-sector, with attributes: Status, Start and End Date, Budget, Implementing
                    Partner NGO, Locations where it will be implemented, the Goals it is fulfilling, Target Number of
                    Beneficiaries, Intermediate Results, WBS, RRP Outputs, PCA Files, Grants and Donors, etc.
                </li>
                <li>Edit PCA - can add new attributes or remove existing ones.</li>
                <li>Delete PCA - a PCA can be deleted, unless the implementation has started. In that case, its status
                    can be set to "canceled".
                </li>
                <li>Filtering of PCAs - is one of the main utilities of the tool, through which one can filter PCAs
                    through one or more conditions, e.g.: by Sector, Indicator, Implementing Partner, CCC as well as
                    through a more advanced filtering of attributes like, budget, locations, grant, start and end dates
                    etc. , and export the results in excel and many other formats.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>Result Structure Setup</p>

            <ul>
                <li>RRP (Regional Response Plan) - belongs to a sector, and is a standardized description of UNICEF's
                    outputs in emergencies.
                </li>
                <li>CCC - How a PCA is contributing to a CCC.</li>
                <li>Indicator - expressed through one (or more Units) and a target number of the corresponding unit. The
                    automatic calculation of shortfall and progress towards target for all indicators, as PCAs are
                    programmed and implemented, is the core feature of the system.
                </li>
                <li>Units - add/edit/remove unit types, e.g. schools, children, women etc. (generally representing
                    beneficiaries or points of interest where activities of PCAs happen or are about)
                </li>
                <li>Activities - generic activities that happen in various PCAs, e.g. training, distribution of water
                    tanks etc.
                </li>
                <li>Intermediate Results, WBS Activity - correspond to a particular sector, with an Intermediate Result
                    having many WBS (work breakdown structure) Activities
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Administrative Data</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Manage Sectors - UNICEF Sectors can be added, edited or removed (unless the sector has CCCs and
                    other data that it is attributed with)
                </li>
                <li>Add administrative data about country - 3 administrative levels are supported: Governorate,
                    District, Cadastral
                </li>
                <li>Add gateways (locations) - these represent schools, health centers and other generic locations where
                    activities happen.
                </li>
                <li>Partners - Partners can be added and assigned to PCAs.</li>
                <li>Donors - donors can be added.</li>
                <li>Grants - can be added and identified uniquely through grant reference numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Dashboard - Visualization of cumulative (i.e. data from all PCAs) current and shortfall target levels,
                categorized by sector.</p>

            <p>Map - a web-based map with bubbles, representing PCAs, which are clustered depending on zoom level and
                categorized through sector, indicator and partner organization.</p>
